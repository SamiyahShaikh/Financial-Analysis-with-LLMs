# Financial-Analysis-with-LLMs

### **Project Overview**
This project leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate various aspects of financial analysis and reporting. It integrates AI-driven natural language processing (NLP) to simplify the extraction of insights from financial data, streamline report generation, and assist in predictive financial modeling. By using tools such as GPT-based models and machine learning algorithms, this project automates key tasks like portfolio optimization, sentiment analysis from market news, and financial forecasting.

### **Key Features**
- **Automated Financial Reports**: Generates detailed, human-readable reports from raw financial data (e.g., balance sheets, income statements).
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Performs sentiment analysis on financial news or social media to identify market trends.
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Provides asset allocation recommendations based on historical performance and market conditions.
- **Document Parsing**: Extracts crucial information from PDFs and financial filings for further analysis.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Predicts future financial trends using historical data and contextual market analysis.

### **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Flask
- **AI Models**: Hugging Face Transformers (GPT models)
- **Data Preprocessing**: Python (Pandas)

### **How to Use**
1. Upload or provide the path to the financial data.
2. The system preprocesses the data, analyzes it using an LLM, and generates a financial report.
3. View the analysis and reports through the frontend interface.
